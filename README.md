Network Analysis of Global Airline Connectivity: A Comparative Study of the USA, UK, China, and Australia :

Analyzing data in the form of a network provides a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among various features and components. This is achieved by representing them as nodes and edges, offering a multi-dimensional approach to understanding complex systems. Utilizing prior knowledge becomes crucial in interpreting networks and predicting desired outcomes. Additionally, network analysis is instrumental in assessing the resilience, robustness, and efficiency of various processes.

We focus on visualizing the network of flights and airports across four distinct countries: the USA, the United Kingdom, China, and Australia. Airports are represented as nodes, and flights are denoted as edges, with edge weights corresponding to passenger traffic volume. Given the global nature of today's world, characterized by increased globalization and rapid economic growth, the proliferation of airports and flights has facilitated convenient global travel for diverse purposes such as medical treatment, education, and tourism.

This involves a detailed visualization of the flight and airport networks, followed by graphical analysis conducted on multiple scales for each of the specified countries. After each graphical plot, selected metrics are discussed and analyzed in relation to the performance considerations relevant to airline networks. This approach aims to provide insights into the efficiency, connectivity, and overall dynamics of the airline networks in the USA, the United Kingdom, China, and Australia.
